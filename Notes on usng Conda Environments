## notes on usng Conda Environments

TO create a new environment on computer use the command in the command prompt, 
when your cmmnd pompt is in the directory that holds the environment.yml file, 
for me it is currently C:\Users\cshuler>: 

conda env create -f environment.yml

Here is an examle environment file: 

name: WX_prs
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - pandas
  - scipy
  - notebook 
  
  
  Note that the - notebook package is key to getting the jupyter notebook to run in the correct environment
  
  
  TO use a project in a certain environment open in in the command prompt with the followin commands 
  
  > conda activate (whatever the environment name is) 
  > jupyter notebook
