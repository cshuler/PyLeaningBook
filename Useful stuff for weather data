pandas.Series.dt
<dateseries>.dt.hour # returns the hour value
<dateseries>.dt.day # returns the day value

#reading in multiple data files into pandas dataframes
#Trick 1
# when you have multiple files in a folder directory <foldername>, and you have a list of the file names in <list>
for i in <list>:
    x = "<foldername>/{0}.format(i)
    
#the "<foldername>/{0}.format(i) will take the file in the list "<foldername>/{0}.format("file1.csv")
#and turn it into a string that says "<foldername>/file1.csv"
# the loop will then make x equal to the root of each file and directory which can then be stored in a dictionary like this: 

datapile = {}  # is an empty dictionary where all of the pandas dataframes will be stored and referenced by the file name 
for i in <list>:
    x = "<foldername>/{0}.format(i)
    key_name = f.replace(".csv", '')  # this makes the key name the name of the file minus the extension 
    datapile[key_name] = d  # thus the key for each entry is key_name and the value is a dataframe of the data
