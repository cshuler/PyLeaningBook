1) Neural Hydrology modules for LSTM hydrological prediction.  Probably the best DL module for prediction Ive ever seen

2) OPG-CNN-Northern-Utah-CIROH-Workshop. 

A nice vanilla example and codebase for implementing a CNN to address a geospatial precip prediciton problem.

4) physically informed nural networks codebase. 
I didnt attend this one...
